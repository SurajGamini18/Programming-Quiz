## Time Series Forecasting Task:
Load a time series dataset (e.g., stock prices, weather data).
Build a recurrent neural network (RNN) or LSTM model using Keras.
Train the model to forecast future values based on historical data.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE).

## Image Classification Task:
Load the MNIST dataset. 
Build a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras Sequential model.
Train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance on a test set and report accuracy.
Use grid search to optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer choice.
Use Callback functions to automate training process like “ReduceLROnPlateau” and keep check on validation loss. Also use history object for result visualization.
